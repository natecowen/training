# MidJourney

Overview: What is MidJourney (MJ)?  is a tool that can generate image via text input. It generates 4 example images for you based off of your input text. You can read their [documentation here](https://docs.midjourney.com). 

In order to use Midjourney you need to join the Midjourney Discord Server. You also need to be subscribed to one of their plans. You can subscribe to MJ by opening their discord server and typing `/subscribe`. 

There are a few ways in which you can use MJ. First, you can join the newbies chat channels and see what others ask or you can ask. However, it's hard to find your own images in this long list of images. It's better to first go to server settings and allow direct messages. Then, create a direct message with the midjourney bot. This way we can have a private chat that keeps a history of our prompts and images. 

Images are randomly generated, we can easily regenerate images, view full size images (upscaled images) of specific images, and continue to tweak the image we choose. You can also laso tool (vary tool) the parts of the image that you want to change and regenerate specifically.
