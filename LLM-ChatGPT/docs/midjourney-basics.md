# MidJourney

Overview: What is MidJourney (MJ)?  is a tool that can generate image via text input. It generates 4 example images for you based off of your input text. You can read their [documentation here](https://docs.midjourney.com). 

In order to use Midjourney you need to join the Midjourney Discord Server. You also need to be subscribed to one of their plans. You can subscribe to MJ by opening their discord server and typing `/subscribe`. 

There are a few ways in which you can use MJ. First, you can join the newbies chat channels and see what others ask or you can ask. However, it's hard to find your own images in this long list of images. It's better to first go to server settings and allow direct messages. Then, create a direct message with the midjourney bot. This way we can have a private chat that keeps a history of our prompts and images. 

Images are randomly generated, we can easily regenerate images, view full size images (upscaled images) of specific images, and continue to tweak the image we choose. You can also laso tool (vary tool) the parts of the image that you want to change and regenerate specifically.

## Midjourney Settings. 

In your discord chat use `/setting` in the chat window to be able to change model versions, stylization settings, speed of rendering, etc. This is also where you can reset your settings back to default.

## Using Our Own Photos as a Starting Point

We can add an image in our private chat with chatgpt and then hit enter. We can then use the `/imagine` or the `describe` commands along with dragging the image from chat history into the prompt. 

> Describe is a function that states what midjourney sees in the photo you've sent it to analyze/imagine.

## Prompting in MidJourney

Images are created in Discord using the `/imagine` command, followed by your prompt. Midjourney prompts are not built the same way as chatGPT. It's not as conversational. 

Midjouney is an opinionated model. It takes a list of prompts from you and takes lots of creative license to generate that. If you want it to be unopinionated, where you can specify all the details... use the "RAW" version. Add `--style raw` in the prompt

### Prompting Templates

Midjourney does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans. Use specific words like "gigantic" or "enormous" instead of the generic word "big." Use commas, brackets, or hyphens to organize your thoughts. 

Use this structure for your main content: Art Style + Subject. Ex: A photo of a pirate

Use these to further hone your prompt: setting, background, atmosphere: Ex: A photo of a pirate, close-up, the ocean in the background, cinematic lighting. 


> Example Art Styles: photo of, oil painting, watercolor painting, illustration, flat illustration, sketch, 3d animation, cartoon, film noir, manga, 8 bit pixel art

> Example of Subject: A pirate vs an old smiling pirate.

> Setting/Perspective: close-up, mid-range, fullbody, portrait, selfie, panorama, fish-eye view etc.  



### Reusable Styles with /prefer

You can create reusable parameters with the options command and the /prefer. Look into all the commands in the documentation (if you subscribe to Midjourney)
